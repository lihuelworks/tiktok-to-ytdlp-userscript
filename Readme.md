## Tiktok - Get list of tiktok links
Adds a simple button to the start of Tiktok page element with id "app-header". The button triggers a link that scrolls through the playlist, tiktok profile, etc and gives you a list of tiktok links that you can iterate with something like [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/).

## Credits
The code that is called on button press is from Dinosauro's [tiktok-to-ytdlp](https://github.com/Dinoosauro/tiktok-to-ytdlp) repo. My userscript only adds the button using a MutationObserver. Please visit and star his repo.
